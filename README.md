# Password Generator - Git Project

## Project Description

This project is a secure password generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Users can generate random passwords directly from a simple web interface.

## Git Workflow

For this project, we followed a standard Git workflow:

1. **Repository Initialization**
   - A GitHub repository was created and the local repo was initialized with all website files.
   - First commit: `init repo` to add all HTML, CSS, and JS files.

2. **Second Commit**
   - Commit `deploy` to simulate a second commit before working on branches.

3. **Branch Creation**
   - `dev` branch: main development branch.
   - `feat/deploy` branch: used to add the deployment script (`deploy.sh`).

4. **Adding the deploy.sh script**
   - A `deploy.sh` file was added in `feat/deploy` to illustrate deployment functionality.

5. **Branch Merge**
   - The `feat/deploy` branch was merged into `dev` to integrate the script into the main development branch.

## Project Contents

- `index.html` : main page of the password generator.  
- `style.css` : website styling and layout.  
- `script.js` : password generation logic.  
- `deploy.sh` : deployment script (in branch `feat/deploy`).  

## Usage
